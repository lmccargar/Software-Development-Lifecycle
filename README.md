How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The "user stories" gives the Scrum-agile team the user's perspective for the project. Letting the team know, who are the users, what they should expect from the solution, and how it will enhance their work duties. The user value statement lets the Scrum-agile team understand who is the users, their vision of the solution, and the abilities they expect the solution to do for them.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

With the knowledge I learned from this course, I will take a look at the whole process of the solution we are providing. Meaning, understanding the end-users perspective, what the stakeholders expect, knowing my role in a Scrum-agile team. I hope I will be on a team that is well verse in the Scrum-agile methodology. So, I could incorporate daily Scrum meetings, user stories, preparing for Sprint events like Sprint planning, Sprint reviews, Sprint retrospective, etc.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe a good team member in software development is dedicated to their profession, this means, keeping up with technology trends, updating technical skills, learning from mistakes, being mentored and mentoring others. Besides the technical profession using soft skills like time management, leadership skills, communication, teamwork, problem solving, having good work ethics, being adaptable, and expect change.
